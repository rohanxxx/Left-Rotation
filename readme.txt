Problem:

A left roation is a operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements
1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left roations are performed on array
[1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].

Given an array a of n integers and a number, d left rotations on the array.
Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-seperated
integers.

Input Format:

The first line contains two space-saperated integers n and d, the size of a
and the number of left roations you must perform.

The second line contians n space-seperated integers a[i].

Output Format:

Print a single line of n space-seperated integers denoting the final state of
the array after performing d left rotations.

Sample Input:

    5 4
    5 1 2 3 4

Sample Output:

    5 1 2 3 4
